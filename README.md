Farmtown
========

###Project Overview###
-----------

A farming/life simulator similar to games like Harvest Moon

This repository is public and does not contain actual game files.

###Getting Started###
-----------
Instructions for joining this project

1.  Download Unity (http://unity3d.com/unity/download/). It is a robust and free tool that this game is built with.
2.  Use the tutorials, manuals, and scripting references to become familier with how games are made with Unity.
3.  Become a collaborator on the github project by messaging Mike Loomis through email at loomismeister@gmail.com.
This will allow you to create a branch off of the master branch that you can develope with.
4.  I use the github GUI program for windows which works very nicely. (http://windows.github.com/)
5.  Once you create a repository from github, open Unity and open a new project using the project folder from the repository. Unity will create new metadata and import the assets for you.
6.  Before you begin any work, read through the this readme and take a look at current milestones on the github page. The project uses 'Issues' to follow bugs and track completion of milestones. Get in touch with Mike Loomis for information on how you can contribute.

###Workflow###
-----------
First, I'd like you to find a specific issue or make one to work on, so we can track progress easily and with order.
Create a branch and name it after yourself, this is going to be your local version of the game files.
When you've completed a task you are working on, request that your branch be merged with the master version by using the Pull Request.
Use the issues section of github to track current milestones as a way to find something to do also.
